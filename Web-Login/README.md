# **Login Form Project - Year 2**

In this project, our group had to create a simple login form using HTML and CSS.

## **Project Requirements**

- The user must fill in the following fields:
  - **Name**
  - **Surname**
  - **Email**
  - **Cell Phone Number**

- The user must set their location by selecting:
  - **Country**
  - **State**
  - **City**

- The application must perform error checking for any null or empty text spaces.
  - Relevant error messages should appear if any required field is left blank.

- After successfully signing in, the user should be directed to a new page that displays all their information.
