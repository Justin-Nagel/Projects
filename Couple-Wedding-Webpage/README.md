# **Wedding Website Project**

Create a website for your friend who is getting married. The aim is to provide essential information about the wedding as well as fun details, such as the backstory of the couple. The website must be aesthetically pleasing and well-laid out. This project is divided into three milestones, which are described below.

## **Project Outline**

### **Home Page**
- The home page of the website should be simple, well laid out, and clean without much clutter.
- It should be easy for the user to navigate to any other page from the home page.
- You may be creative and implement elements as you please, but ensure that you follow best practices and that your site is HTML5 compliant.

### **Implementation Requirements**
- **Menu Implementation**
  - This should be done using lists and CSS.
  
- **Page Layout**
  - This should be done using HTML5 semantic structure.
  
- **Resource Linking**
  - Strictly dynamic URLs may be used.
  
- **Page Content**
  - Strictly HTML5; other technologies will not be assessed.
  
- **Page Layout**
  - Strictly CSS.
  
- **Background**
  - Can be done using gradients, color, or pictures. However, pictures must be justifiable and should contribute to a beautifully styled website.

**Note:** Tables should not be used to structure the layout on any of your pages.

### **Additional Grading Criteria**
- Professional and consistent look and feel.
- Ease of use (navigation throughout the website).
- Naming standards applied in coding.
- Proper use of HTML5 and CSS in combination.
- Good file structure.

Please view the appendices below for guidance on the expected layout and structure. This should also give an indication of the expected level of detail. You are not required to make an exact replica of the implementation provided. Your design must, as a basic requirement, be comparable to the samples.

**Note:** An immediate fail will be awarded to any student who uses templates in this project.

## **Important Aspects to Remember**
1. The feel of a website for a wedding is very important for the bride.
2. The couple loves music and videos and wants to share their favorites on the website (which to use is up to you).
3. When users RSVP for the wedding, there should be a form with a variety of questions, such as diet options, gift type, etc.
4. Only people who were invited should be able to log in to the website and RSVP.
5. Clearly display every aspect of your HTML and CSS knowledge with a variety of techniques.
6. None of the components need to be functional. Instead, components should only show a representation of what they would look like and the process flow for the website (ease of use is very important).
7. You need to have a minimum of five different web pages.
