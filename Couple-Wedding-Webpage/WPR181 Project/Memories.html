                    <p>
                        When we first met, we already knew we were meant for each other. We went on one date after the other, seeing each other more often, even <i>wanting</i> to see each other. No matter how hard or long our days' were, whenever we would see each other it would be the best part about that day.

                    <p>
                        We were slowly growing on each other, soon we couldn't be without one another. As time went on, we went on vacations together. We really wanted to be together. Deep down I think we both knew it was time for the big question.

                    <p>
                        We went for a stroll in the park. When I looked back I saw him on his knee with his hands behind his back. Even though I knew what was going to happen I couldn't help but it, but I cried. I guess no one can hold back tears when they are getting engaged!

                        Today was the best days of our lives'. Still to this day all of this feels like a dream. Of all people I could've fell in love with I am glad it was him. We decided to have the wedding on the same day as when we went on our first date, because of how special that day was.
